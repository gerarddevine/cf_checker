              The CF-checker was developed at the Hadley 
              Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK Met Office by Rosalyn 
              Hatcher. This work was supported by PRISM (PRogramme for Integrated 
              Earth System Modelling).
              <p/>
              Development and maintenance for the CF-checker has now been taken 
              over by the NCAS Computational Modelling Services (NCAS-CMS). If 
              you have suggestions for improvement then please e-mail Rosalyn 
              Hatcher at NCAS-CMS (r.s.hatcher@reading.ac.uk).

              For details of the NetCDF format and the CF Convention go to the NetCDF 
              format page or the CF Convention page.
              <p/>
              There are some requirements of the convention that it is difficult or 
              impossible to implement in the Checker. A list of aspects which the 
              checker doesn't check can be found here.
